# TaskApp
This app allows you to create **tasks** based on **hours**.
For example you may want to start working on a project at 8:00am. You would:
1. Select a time
2. Type in your task
3. Press enter
---
This action adds your task to a list. The list of tasks is organised and displayed in a descending order with the earliest task starting from the top and the latest task of the day at the bottom.
From here you have two options:
1. Click on the listed task
2. Click on the **x** in the right hand corner of the listed task
---
If you *click* on the listed task, your task would be added to the finished tasks list
If you *click* on the **x**, that task would get deleted from the list of tasks
---
The app keeps a tally of your added tasks and you finished tasks and presents it in a graph
